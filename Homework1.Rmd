# 1a) Read the data file into a variable called su
su <- read.delim("Su_raw_matrix.txt")

# 1b) Find mean and standard deviation of the Liver_2.CEL column
mean_liver2 <- mean(su$Liver_2.CEL, na.rm = TRUE)  # mean, ignore NA values
sd_liver2 <- sd(su$Liver_2.CEL, na.rm = TRUE)      # standard deviation, ignore NAs

# Print results for checking
print(paste("Mean:", mean_liver2))
print(paste("Std Dev:", sd_liver2))

# 1c) Find average and total for each column
col_means <- colMeans(su, na.rm = TRUE)   # average for each column
col_sums  <- colSums(su, na.rm = TRUE)    # sum for each column

# Optional: Print summaries

# 2: Generate histograms for different standard deviations (sigma)

# 2a) mean=0, sigma=0.2
x1 <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)

# Comment: The histogram with sigma=0.5 is much wider (greater spread),
# because standard deviation determines the spread or variability of the data.
